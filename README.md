**Six end-to-end projects built using machine learning with OpenCV, Python, and TensorFlow**

## What is this book about?
Python is the ideal programming language for rapidly prototyping and developing production-grade codes for image processing and Computer Vision with its robust syntax and wealth of powerful libraries. This book will help you design and develop production-grade Computer Vision projects tackling real-world problems.

This book covers the following exciting features:
Install and run major Computer Vision packages within Python 
Apply powerful support vector machines for simple digit classification 
Understand deep learning with TensorFlow 
Build a deep learning classifier for general images 
Use LSTMs for automated image captioning 
Read text from real-world images 
Extract human pose data from images
